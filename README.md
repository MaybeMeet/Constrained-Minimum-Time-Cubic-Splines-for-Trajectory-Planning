## Synopsis

A simple and easy to follow matlab code demonstrating the generation of optimized minimum time cubic splines with general boundary velocities and maximum velocity constraints.
It also includes multivariable spline generation as usually is the case for robotic manipulator. 
Further constraints can be easily added for single or multiple variables.

## Motivation
This project is carried out specifically for creating minimum time trajectories for robotic manipulators with n-dofs with general velocity and torque constraints.
Although in this project torque constraints are not added as it requires the specific use of robot dynamics.
